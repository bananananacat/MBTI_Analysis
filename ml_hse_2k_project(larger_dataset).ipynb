can relat to this onli three peopl in my life ever told me that they felt calm and understood when i was around i wasnt awar of this until then becaus i never conscious said someth to n i had over valu at the begin and wouldv had to answer question it was difficult to select just a few of them and im not sure how accur it actual is realli good and n the thing that so beauti about relationship is that one love the other just as much i alway felt like it was the enfp i fell in love with and i felt like we complet n in my experi they alway take they wont inject you with anyth without a doctor and i was alway told what it was a few more horror stori my mother was a nurs befor n authent i general like peopl that are true to themselv so much in our societi is fake and i just have this uncomfort feel when i encount it i think i valu art and love or n veri difficult i was in a similar place of mind and i just need time and some input to work thing out and grow as a person i dont think it wouldv work if someon sent me someth i need n i mean if shes singl whi not enfp and infj work great togeth i wouldnt mind if i was in her place worst thing that can happen is her say no n im into sane peopl that realli hot n true but if you combin all of the statist you could say that or more of the human popul suffer from some kind of mental ill that pretti crazi to think about but your right n i think you misunderstood a crucial part as an exampl let take a video where someon hand get cut off if a psychopath see it his reaction will be yup that a cut now the hand is off n n if infj are so like to suffer from emot trauma whi are they one of the least type to suffer from addict i work in the field and statist and my experi n when did you have your first relationship what do you look for in a partner intellig empathi a good sens of humor easygo just a interest n i dont know ive been in a coupl troubl situat and was the first one to take respons even when my mother die i was the one take care of my father befor i even thought about n yes i was alway confus by my person but someth realli chang me and i cant realli figur it out i think pain realli shape who i am to an extend that existenti i went to a n factori girl i dont know whi but alway fascin me in a way i realli identifi with her anyway person i n whi do peopl alway tri to show their domin those that tri dont have ani it all pretend just treat peopl right it not about it about honesti n kinda i write sometim and i make some music from time to time but it alway difficult becaus it just come out of a moment and minut later im like what the hell is this i dont n around minut then i start to feel kinda awkward or uncomfort over time i realiz that it not alway the case and that im just afraid of be bore but it alway a step to take if n agre with and but increas unemploy lobbi internet secur and pollut worri me the most the unemploy happen natur and there no way to stop it but n rather spontan when it come to experi and social i have idea on what to do or where to go but i found that it more fulfil to just go with the moment as an exampl i n i dont know if this is a infj thing but it appli to me i just want to have a real convers which would requir full attent from both side this isnt possibl if im busi so i repli n that was truli amaz and show my thought process about this exact problem realli well im kinda blown away by how well this was made i think if you would appli these profil i would count n not realli even if there werent ani problem i felt uncomfort just know that there somebodi els in the hous i guess i wouldnt feel that way if i found the right person to live with n appli to me i mistyp as intj for year until i got more in touch with my emot type as infj and understood the cognit function behind it trauma depress and anxieti can n i had a realli hard time answer the question most of the time they all kinda appli or didnt anyway domin steadi influenc you have a strong inner n i didnt like the test and dont think it repres eq in ani way what make eq test difficult is that there are no right answer most of the time anyway if anyth they should focus on n no this isnt a type thing it not as much about core person as the experi and influenc one had social movement give peopl mean and selfesteem they feel like they belong to n i wouldnt call it addict but i definit get some kind of rush i learn over time to not take this as serious even though i feel someon doesnt mean the relationship is as serious or n i dont know her just saw a coupl interview one of the more reason question definit fe ti and she give off a ni vibe could be infj n i slowli grew depress over time and i kinda learn to live with it i think it a natur feel and posit toward societi and life to be honest what help me was to believ in the n i dont like polit or social movement in general especi in today world i think there a lack of intellectu and ration when it come to polit it about ident emot n break news just becaus someon act differ to what you know doesnt mean theyr not type x or or whatev just trust eachoth about their type they know themselv n i dont want to hear ani lie or empti word and i dont realli want to talk about my feel or what go on either but it realli help if someon is just cheer get distract and pull n what are your whi to mayb make this world a better place i grew up around miseri and it still the onli thing im realli abl to see it wasnt alway my aspir but n i hate ignor and injustic i realli dont care if someon make a joke or say someth offens but if i see someon serious hurt other im get furious there are some n consid infp to be my emot soul mate and i often get along with them great i dont quit understand whi infp seem to be so unpopular on here i think out of everi mbti person type n that true still i havent seen anyth that has proven me wrong either peopl think your a shallow shell of a human be or a inferior piec of shit that you can treat howev you want n i think shes tri to manipul you shes and selfloath that doesnt have to be a bad thing it a normal human reaction but i dont think she has realli understood whi you n to manipul time for the most part i onli come up with the right respons after it all happen n noth be ugli and be handsom is pretti much the same i know becaus i was consid ugli as a child and general handsom as an adult most peopl dont take you serious either way and n definit a mix between owl and cat with a small touch of phoenix n n ago overal i think it easier for a domin sensor to understand an intuit than the other way around or atleast i think i had a harder time ration figur out where he was come n it depend on the person i have met some sensor that i got along with great
