to my environ and how ever sinc you join you exhibit much higher se than ni you also show much higher ti than hmmm interest sorri if my repli is weird im current high how exact is it that yes that right children inherit their quirk from their parent but the realli import thing is not that connect but recognis your own flesh and blood recognis yourself that interest how come was it pure base on this post or just observ across various post i didnt ask him so i cant be certain lol but im pretti sure he wasnt woah lol i didnt make fun of him for not the beer i teas him a littl about drink it so slowli i feel like there is a signific differ the teas wasnt even becaus he was this\",\n          \"i can relat to this onli three peopl in my life ever told me that they felt calm and understood when i was around i wasnt awar of this until then becaus i never conscious said someth to i had over valu at the begin and wouldv had to answer question it was difficult to select just a few of them and im not sure how accur it actual is realli good and the thing that so beauti about relationship is that one love the other just as much i alway felt like it was the enfp i fell in love with and i felt like we complet in my experi they alway take they wont inject you with anyth without a doctor and i was alway told what it was a few more horror stori my mother was a nurs befor authent i general like peopl that are true to themselv so much in our societi is fake and i just have this uncomfort feel when i encount it i think i valu art and love or veri difficult i was in a similar place of mind and i just need time and some input to work thing out and grow as a person i dont think it wouldv work if someon sent me someth i need i mean if shes singl whi not enfp and infj work great togeth i wouldnt mind if i was in her place worst thing that can happen is her say no im into sane peopl that realli hot true but if you combin all of the statist you could say that or more of the human popul suffer from some kind of mental ill that pretti crazi to think about but your right i think you misunderstood a crucial part as an exampl let take a video where someon hand get cut off if a psychopath see it his reaction will be yup that a cut now the hand is off if infj are so like to suffer from emot trauma whi are they one of the least type to suffer from addict i work in the field and statist and my experi when did you have your first relationship what do you look for in a partner intellig empathi a good sens of humor easygo just a interest i dont know ive been in a coupl troubl situat and was the first one to take respons even when my mother die i was the one take care of my father befor i even thought about yes i was alway confus by my person but someth realli chang me and i cant realli figur it out i think pain realli shape who i am to an extend that existenti i went to a factori girl i dont know whi but alway fascin me in a way i realli identifi with her anyway person i whi do peopl alway tri to show their domin those that tri dont have ani it all pretend just treat peopl right it not about it about honesti kinda i write sometim and i make some music from time to time but it alway difficult becaus it just come out of a moment and minut later im like what the hell is this i dont around minut then i start to feel kinda awkward or uncomfort over time i realiz that it not alway the case and that im just afraid of be bore but it alway a step to take if agre with and but increas unemploy lobbi internet secur and pollut worri me the most the unemploy happen natur and there no way to stop it but rather spontan when it come to experi and social i have idea on what to do or where to go but i found that it more fulfil to just go with the moment as an exampl i i dont know if this is a infj thing but it appli to me i just want to have a real convers which would requir full attent from both side this isnt possibl if im busi so i repli that was truli amaz and show my thought process about this exact problem realli well im kinda blown away by how well this was made i think if you would appli these profil i would count not realli even if there werent ani problem i felt uncomfort just know that there somebodi els in the hous i guess i wouldnt feel that way if i found the right person to live with appli to me i mistyp as intj for year until i got more in touch with my emot type as infj and understood the cognit function behind it trauma depress and anxieti can i had a realli hard time answer the question most of the time they all kinda appli or didnt anyway domin steadi influenc you have a strong inner i didnt like the test and dont think it repres eq in ani way what make eq test difficult is that there are no right answer most of the time anyway if anyth they should focus on no this isnt a type thing it not as much about core person as the experi and influenc one had social movement give peopl mean and selfesteem they feel like they belong to i wouldnt call it addict but i definit get some kind of rush i learn over time to not take this as serious even though i feel someon doesnt mean the relationship is as serious or i dont know her just saw a coupl interview one of the more reason question definit fe ti and she give off a ni vibe could be infj i slowli grew depress over time and i kinda learn to live with it i think it a natur feel and posit toward societi and life to be honest what help me was to believ in the i dont like polit or social movement in general especi in today world i think there a lack of intellectu and ration when it come to polit it about ident emot break news just becaus someon act differ to what you know doesnt mean theyr not type x or or whatev just trust eachoth about their type they know themselv i dont want to hear ani lie or empti word and i dont realli want to talk about my feel or what go on either but it realli help if someon is just cheer get distract and pull what are your whi to mayb make this world a better place i grew up around miseri and it still the onli thing im realli abl to see it wasnt alway my aspir but i hate ignor and injustic i realli dont care if someon make a joke or say someth offens but if i see someon serious hurt other im get furious there are some consid infp to be my emot soul mate and i often get along with them great i dont quit understand whi infp seem to be so unpopular on here i think out of everi mbti person type that true still i havent seen anyth that has proven me wrong either peopl think your a shallow shell of a human be or a inferior piec of shit that you can treat howev you want i think shes tri to manipul you shes and selfloath that doesnt have to be a bad thing it a normal human reaction but i dont think she has realli understood whi you to manipul time for the most part i onli come up with the right respons after it all happen noth be ugli and be handsom is pretti much the same i know becaus i was consid ugli as a child and general handsom as an adult most peopl dont take you serious either way and definit a mix between owl and cat with a small touch of phoenix ago overal i think it easier for a domin sensor to understand an intuit than the other way around or atleast i think i had a harder time ration figur out where he was come it depend on the person i have met some sensor that i got along with great other have just complet differ interest and viewpoint so there not a lot to talk about my father is a\",\n          \"honest that doesnt sound like a friend i would like to keep but i guess you have

when im ill i should be doing something unless im sleeping not necessarily doing something but moving towards something so if im ill lol it okay thats exactly like something i would do infact i did this today social interaction verbal and nonverbal communication restricted and repetitive behavior usual by age two i dont really recognise these basic symptom of you know it funny something just hit

finally got my brace off are you sure you dont want a hug from me when we meet up enxp leaning on enfp the many being simply that wherever i go across the internet about the mbti the loop theory seems to be openly accepted if it brought up it rarely challenged so obviously to me it why is there no such thing a an niti loop many say there is and i believed there is so im gonna have to read an explanation before i throw away that concept i had another one of those moment again sometimes i feel extreme nostalgia for place ive never been before when i wa young i wa sure that it wa an indicator of where i wa during talking to a sensor type can be to anyone each person is an individual that is developed independently there is already black is it possible to change it to instead lol i had a stranger stop me today and talk to me about how well spoken i am first time for everything i never would have known either stuff like that is really nice to here some people just change to black thank you i find myself in a different place moment to moment the change are so frequent i seem to forget who i wa just before what wa i thinking the answer me i just want to hold on to archetypal stand up comedy might just be the next big im naturally agreeable too but whenever i notice this indecisiveness in a group just for the sake of the group i notice i take charge and make a decision lol like watching people really currently having my first relationship with my isfp thing are great but ofcourse it the start thing are supposed to be great we were pretty much best friend for a year while she wasnt hey youre type too maybe that ha something to do with it im about to go to my parttime job i work a a bartender i have extreme anxiety during the hour leading up to work everytime nothing actually go wrong during work so the anxiety is dam you were a good looking kid and a good looking man sometimes people fall off and go from good to bad and sometimes people puberty doe wonder bad to good there something nice about i feel like im the same just with more in a sense ive always been going towards the same of thinking since day maybe that mean im immature i sober now lol interesting i never knew i did that not the lol part lol although ive always known that i have a particular fixation on se that i dont notice in other infjs however it ever since you joined you exhibit much higher se than ni you also show much higher ti than my girlfriend is isfp she cant understand how im so oblivious to my environment and how ever since you joined you exhibit much higher se than ni you also show much higher ti than hmmm interesting sorry if my reply is weird im currently high how exactly is it that yes thats right child inherit their quirk from their parent but the really important thing is not that connection but your own flesh and blood yourself thats interesting how come wa it purely based on this post or just observation across various post i didnt ask him so i cant be certain lol but im pretty sure he wasnt woah lol i didnt make fun of him for not the beer i teased him a little about drinking it so slowly i feel like there is a significant difference the teasing wasnt even because he wa this\",\n          \"i can relate to this only three people in my life ever told me that they felt calm and understood when i wa around i wasnt aware of this until then because i never consciously said something to i had over value at the beginning and wouldve had to answer question it wa difficult to select just a few of them and im not sure how accurate it actually is really good and the thing thats so beautiful about relationship is that one love the other just a much i always felt like it wa the enfp i fell in love with and i felt like we completed in my experience they always take they wont you with anything without a doctor and i wa always told what it wa a few more horror story my mother wa a nurse before authenticity i generally like people that are true to themselves so much in our society is fake and i just have this uncomfortable feeling when i encounter it i think i value art and love or very difficult i wa in a similar place of mind and i just needed time and some input to work thing out and grow a a person i dont think it wouldve worked if someone sent me something i needed i mean if shes single why not enfp and infj work great together i wouldnt mind if i wa in her place worst thing that can happen is her saying no im into sane people thats really hot true but if you combine all of the statistic you could say that or more of the human population suffer from some kind of mental illness thats pretty crazy to think about but youre right i think you misunderstood a crucial part a an example let take a video where someone hand get cut off if a psychopath see it his reaction will be yup thats a cut now the hand is off if infjs are so likely to suffer from emotional trauma why are they one of the least type to suffer from addiction i work in the field and statistic and my experience when did you have your first relationship what do you look for in a partner intelligence empathy a good sense of humor easygoing just a interesting i dont know ive been in a couple troubling situation and wa the first one to take responsibility even when my mother died i wa the one taking care of my father before i even thought about yes i wa always confused by my personality but something really changed me and i cant really figure it out i think pain really shaped who i am to an extend thats existential i went to a factory girl i dont know why but always fascinated me in a way i really identified with her anyway personally i why do people always try to show their dominance those that try dont have any it all pretend just treat people right it not about it about honesty kinda i write sometimes and i make some music from time to time but it always difficult because it just come out of a moment and minute later im like what the hell is this i dont around minute then i start to feel kinda awkward or uncomfortable over time i realized that it not always the case and that im just afraid of being boring but it always a step to take if agreed with and but increasing unemployment internet security and pollution worry me the most the unemployment happens naturally and there no way to stop it but rather spontaneous when it come to experience and socializing i have idea on what to do or where to go but i found that it more fulfilling to just go with the moment a an example i i dont know if this is a infj thing but it applies to me i just want to have a real conversation which would require full attention from both side this isnt possible if im busy so i reply that wa truly amazing and show my thought process about this exact problem really well im kinda blown away by how well this wa made i think if you would apply these profile i would count not really even if there werent any problem i felt uncomfortable just knowing that there somebody else in the house i guess i wouldnt feel that way if i found the right person to live with applies to me i mistyped a intj for year until i got more in touch with my emotion typed a infj and understood the cognitive function behind it trauma depression and anxiety can i had a really hard time answering the question most of the time they all kinda applied or didnt anyways dominance influence you have a strong inner i didnt like the test and dont think it represents eq in any way what make eq test difficult is that there are no right answer most of the time anyway if anything they should focus on no this isnt a type thing it not a much about core personality a the experience and influence one had social movement give people meaning and selfesteem they feel like they belong to i wouldnt call it addicted but i definitely get some kind of rush i learned over time to not take this a seriously even though i feel someone doesnt mean the relationship is a serious or i dont know her just saw a couple interview one of the more reasonable question definitely fe ti and she give off a ni vibe could be infj i slowly grew depressed over time and i kinda learned to live with it i think it a natural feeling and position towards society and life to be honest what helped me wa to believe in the i dont like political or social movement in general especially in today world i think there a lack of intellectualism and when it come to politics it about identity emotion breaking news just because someone act differently to what you know doesnt mean theyre not type x or or whatever just trust eachother about their typing they know themselves i dont want to hear any lie or empty word and i dont really want to talk about my feeling or whats going on either but it really help if someone is just cheerful getting distracted and pulled what are your why to maybe make this world a better place i grew up around misery and it still the only thing im really able to see it wasnt always my aspiration but i hate ignorance and injustice i really dont care if someone make a joke or say something offensive but if i see someone seriously hurting others im getting furious there are some consider infps to be my emotional soul mate and i often get along with them great i dont quite understand why infps seem to be so unpopular on here i think out of every mbti personality type thats true still i havent seen anything that ha proven me wrong either people think youre a shallow shell of a human being or a inferior piece of shit that you

to manipulate time for the most part i only come up with the right response after it all happened nothing being ugly and being handsome is pretty much the same i know because i wa considered ugly a a child and generally handsome a an adult most people dont take you serious either way and definitely a mix between owl and cat with a small touch of phoenix ago overall i think it easier for a dominant sensor to understand an intuitive than the other way around or atleast i think i had a harder time rationally figuring out where he wa coming it depends on the person i have met some sensor that i got
