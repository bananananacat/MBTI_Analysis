try to judge personally too quickly or control them also make the first move to show youre interested in talking with them N i used to feel about the same until i read the book man where a lesbian woman dressed like a man and tried to live a one she noticed herself being considered a feminine man quite N im not sure what the hell is going on in this thread but i would like to say i know no entjs personally i dont think itd be neat though N all church are form of political institution catholic and orthodox one have the benefit of being all have declared doctrine in one way or another youre speaking against N and here is the most boring post in the whole thread N what part if it the idea of a teaching authority you have a problem with all church until the th century if it the idea of a group being guided by the holy spirit in their decision on N for catholic the church ha a dual meaning the whole of the believer the body of christ and the political institution for catholicism their teaching of christ are said to be protected by N priest were to other so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves again poor decision but that wa their decision the church first priority N well sure then yes the church did protect child offender the church reasoning wa the image of the church itself and the their leadership own ignorance of the size of the problem the church N edit based double post N no it really isnt the bible itself is the canon collection of text the bible wa established once the and historical work wa done to establish the canon and it wa not modified N yes nevermind it because the two claim do not contradict each other at all i could work through how there is no contradiction if youre struggling i wouldnt say all no thats a N there no way to tell but many of them depend on logic andor history that contradicts or ruin their claim granted there are a few case of were yet to be able to know but many of it can N the problem of is a grand way of yourself about scientific finding when youre younger it brings into question if what we know is what we could call true N cube N make no sense id advise otherwise atheism and are the only two rational choice N you motherfucker N what is the meaning of everything the universe exists we are to learn to love in it N disappointed year old reporting in good luck op N this is exceedingly naive the early church before scripture applied their teaching to better society after scripture it wa held in high esteem a a basis to properly better society most work N from the catholic list of official teaching here is how we are to read the bible iii the holy spirit of scripture in sacred scripture god speaks to man in a N i never liked people pointing to the scandinavian model for the success of their economic system and not their incredible oil and natural resource supply compared to their small population N while shit just got stupid for a moment let try to get back on track N youre pretty smart you know that look at this fucker she think im smart pfft N exceedingly poor N ive just been told im bright but im sure most everyone else say the same to the kid N and what of you N the most efficient way to remove selfdoubt is to stop doubting yourself so much faith and trust N you suspect wrongly i like the chatter and im being friendly with you i seriously do hope you have a good day too N indeed you do feel free to bullshit with me if you want have a good one man N id say thats a stretch to say catholic believe the bible wa inspired by god but written by men orthodox do too a they the biblical canon id have to say they have the greatest say N edit welp N i see the argument for inconsistency sometimes they arent actually inconsistency sometimes they are i find the simplest example of a true one being the rabbit that is apparently chewing N sorry to take so long to get back to you my internet ha been screwing up horribly a for the answer there wa a considerable amount of thing that got me off the atheist train but if i were to N the believing portion wa a long and process for me i researched culture a a hobby and eventually i rolled around to religion it wa an interesting topic for me and i eventually began to N to your first statement just what where did that even come from of course they can know love though with god they can know it fully id argue a for hell it taken a variety of N im very mixed on him his criticism of christianity and envy now that ive seen the video is while popular piss poor and max did a wonderful job making an argument otherwise on his N people believing in something a true is what get people into a rage why just the true why not the true why not just majority opinion to N sure thing sound sorta similar to the paradox will exists to strengthen the good if you create a people so they may know love they cannot sincerely know love if they N yo christian intp here anything you want N it not we can make healthy child it we only let the healthy baby live which is the issue it a moral issue about the innate value of life N\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

someon you bare n so im a year old male who has been strike out time and time again when it come to relationship ive been in one relationship my entir life that last like year and end when i was n i dont think this sort of date method is veri reason and at best it is counterproduct be friend first just throw a wrench in what is normal a smooth date process when you fear n never was a kiss n i appreci the feedback i think im just go to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedic a decent amount of time to it what is happen right now is drag thing out and n i dont know after think more im on the verg of give up it has noth to do with see her or not make it offici or what have you it that she keep thing n i dont know im not a model or anyth but im decent look shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guy are alway after her it seem but im also smarter and have better career n i like your answer but mayb im just be optimist it is basic what ive been do i cant shake the feel that she wouldnt be give me ani of her time if she werent interest and n how am i suppos to know if an infj just want to be friend thing have been veri weird with an infj ive been see ive been veri upfront about my intent and she essenti told me she n interest i find it unusu infj are known for take forev to open up and trust peopl yet all the respons so far have indic kiss in or fewer date n my infj friend has been with an intj and i dont want to bust your confid but even though she like him at first she soon found out that he was put her down and felt cage i can see that n enlighten us infj also indic your gender and if you initi n well there was more than that she also said she was basic tri to figur out if im trustworthi and decent n those two thing seem at odd how can you be simultan not say thing that need to be said but also be proactiv aggress n pretti much yeah women just do not enjoy my compani on ani level im in the same situat never had ani femal friend date one person in my life and it last a littl less than two year the n i dont think that is go to help me dig myself out of the veri clingi seem hole i dug myself i basic ask her if she knew i was romant interest and she respond of cours lol n i should have just let thing proceed at a natur pace pretti piss at myself about zero chanc she speak to me again n i read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anyth good chanc she lost interest after my blunt though lol n i broke that off short after my post i felt like a ball i onli did it becaus peopl were tell me shes a lost caus and i should see other peopl btw i have a veri well develop n updat on this told her i like her and got no reassur she like me or even that she wasnt interest those who said she was ambival were right im pretti much call it off at this point n yeah so i told her and didnt get an affirm she like me nor that she didnt she basic said she had known for a while i like her pretti much what i expect probabl go to call it n is the crystal ball refer suppos to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not p n so ive gone on six or so date with an infj over a month period shes pretti busi and me too and recent i feel like progress has been a littl for a bit i thought she was warm up n she hate text and yeah she told me how picki she was about peopl recent and that normal she wouldnt give anyon the time of day n you would liter have to have an autism spectrum disord i would know not to mention you dont tell someon who is just friend how much you like them that would be more than bizarr n it kind of hard to get to the point of offici date when you have no idea what is go on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in horror and assault n spoke to her last night she essenti said she like me a lot and would normal never make ani time for peopl unless she was oblig to but she also indirect use the word friend but it n so i met an infj femal a while back and weve been out like five or so time on a date they go well we get along everyth seem nice i find her veri attract and we have quit a bit in n i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a femal on her appear until she trust me i did compliment her person a few time she is extrem cautious from what i n well now i have a new question went on a second date a few day ago and it went well and she said she want to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounc of flirt or touch n she start initi with me and ask if im free soon if there is anyth to be learn it is dont play the analysi game you will lose n expect of n i dont know i cant realli fault a strong introvert for be wari about someon she doesnt realli know number is cruel but it is how modern date work pretti sure this isnt the n i dont know i cant realli fault a strong introvert for be wari about someon she doesnt realli know number is cruel but it is how modern date work pretti sure this isnt the n thank option seem most like it seem whenev i final get her to open up there is like a of good convers that final ensu but it is like pull teeth initi then i n im social retard and would know that if a random stranger ask for my contact info then ask me out for drink or lunch then the person probabl isnt interest in just be friend n so i shouldnt be deter by the fact she doesnt realli ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appear like someon who cant take a hint or who put someon els in an awkward situat i worri n no this seem to fit her pretti well n thank for the advic everyon i appreci your

dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friend first just throw a in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fear N never wa a kiss N i appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging thing out and N i dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it ha nothing to do with seeing her or not making it official or what have you it that she keep thing N i dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guy are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better career N i like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested and N how am i supposed to know if an infj just want to be friend thing have been very weird with an infj ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intention and she essentially told me she N interesting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the response so far have indicated kissing in or fewer date N my infj friend ha been with an intj and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he wa putting her down and felt i can see that N enlighten u infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiated N well there wa more than that she also said she wa basically trying to figure

my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friend dated one person in my life and it lasted a little le than two year the N i dont think that is going to help me dig myself

pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me again N i read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though lol N i broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developed N update on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she wa ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this point N yeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call it N is the crystal

like progress ha been a little for a bit i thought she wa warming up N she hate texting and yeah she told me how picky she wa about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of day N you would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friend how much you like them that would be more than bizarre N it kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in horror and assault N spoke to her last night she essentially said she like me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she wa obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but it N so i met an infj female a while back and weve been out like five or so time on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in N i dont know i kind of have a rule

like pulling teeth initially then i N im socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drink or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friend N so i shouldnt be by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who put someone else in an awkward
